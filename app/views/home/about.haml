%h1 About Work Tracker

%hr

%h3 OMG another time tracking tool. Why?

%p I built Work Tracker to scratch my own itch. Sure, there's a hundred other timesheet & invoicing systems out there, but the ones I had tried didn't feel right, didn't seem to meet my needs. Maybe they were targeting a different user, maybe they just don't think the way I do, maybe I didn't take the time to learn them properly, but nothing stuck. After using Google spreadsheets for a few months, I decided to make my own.

%p You may find Work Tracker useful if you:

%ul
  %li Are a freelancer managing multiple clients and multiple projects
  %li Track your own hours and generate your own invoices, but aren't fully happy with your current timesheet & invoicing system
  %li Care about time efficiency and love it when an app saves you that one unnecessary extra click

%p Work Tracker is free to use, and the code is open source. #{link_to "See the Github project here", "https://github.com/topherhunt/work_tracker", target: "_blank"}, or #{link_to "see some of my other projects here", "http://topherhunt.github.io/projects.html", target: "_blank"}.

%h3 Getting started

%h4 1. Set up a few projects

%p After you sign up, click on the Projects link in the navbar to start setting up the categories that you'll put your time in. Projects can be nested and can represent whatever buckets are useful to you: different clients, different websites, whatever boundaries you need to do invoicing and to explore how you're spending your time.

%p For each project, you can specify an hourly rate that will be used when generating invoices. If you don't specify a rate, the project will "inherit" the rate from its parent project. If a project has no hourly rate, it's assumed to be pro bono / volunteer / unbillable.

%h4 2. Track your time!

%p Click on the Timesheet link, and keep this page open in your browser. (I "pin" this tab open next to Gmail and Wunderlist.) When you start working on a specific project, use the <strong>New timer</strong> quick-start menu to select a project, then click <span class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Start</span>. When you're done, click <span class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Stop</span>.

%p At any point, click the #{glyph("pencil")} pencil icon to change the details for a work entry. Some details that can be changed here are:

%ul
  %li <strong>Date</strong> - the day that this work entry occurred. Work Tracker only cares about the date, not the time of day.
  %li <strong>Duration</strong> - how many hours you worked during this entry. If blank, that means your clock is still running.
  %li <strong>Is billable?</strong> - will this work item be billed to the client? This defaults to <strong>true</strong> if you have an hourly rate set for this client.
  %li <strong>Is billed?</strong> - if billable, <em>has</em> this item been billed to the client?
  %li <strong>Invoice notes</strong> - notes on what you accomplished, etc. These will be visible on invoices.
  %li <strong>Private notes</strong> - any notes you'd like to make to yourself that should <em>not</em> be visible to the client.

%p You can also click the <span class="btn btn-info btn-xs">Edit</span> button to create a new entry and jump right into changing its details; this is useful if you want to quickly create entries for some time you've already worked.

%p As you work, the gray box at the top of the timesheet will show you a summary of how much time you've worked today.

%h4 3. Billing and invoicing

%p My billing & invoicing workflow varies from project to project, so I tried to allow for a couple different ways to track billing status:

%p <strong>A: Mark each entry as billed</strong>

%p Each billable work entry has a <strong>billed</strong> flag. Once you've billed for a particular work entry, on the timesheet, click on the #{content_tag :span, glyph("check"), class: "btn btn-default btn-xs"} checkbox icon in the billing column to mark it as billed.

%p <strong>B: Generate invoices</strong>

%p Click on the <strong>Invoices</strong> link in the navbar to generate a new invoice. For the new invoice, you'll need to select a client, a start date, and an end date, then click <span class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Preview</span>. A breakdown of all work entries to be included in this invoice (plus any <em>excluded</em> entries or potential problems) will be displayed. When you're satisfied, click <span class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Create</span>. This records the invoice in our system; click on the invoice's <strong>view</strong> link to open up that invoice for printing.

%p When you generate an invoice, it marks all of its work entries so they can't accidentally be included in a different invoice. You'll be warned if you try to do so.
